*********** SIMILAR FUNCTIONALITY BUT SIMPLER TO USE ************ <br>

A program to process and summarise ROR organisation data, as made available by ROR 
on Zenodo (see https://ror.readme.io/docs/data-dump). A new version of the data is posted 
on a roughly monthly basis. 

The program processes and retains a single version at a time, 
but retains summaries of the key features of all versions imported. Data is stored using a 
Postgres database. As outputs, the system can summarise any specific version as a text file, 
or create a set of CSV files representing the stored summary data, for a single version or 
for all those so far imported.

The system uses the version 2 schema files as input, and so covers data 
made available from April 2024 onwards. It can handle versions 2.0 and 2.1, the latter in 
use from December 2024.

The system is written in Rust and uses a command line interface (CLI) for control. 
<i>N.B. At the moment, the program is not yet available as a stand alone .exe or .lib file, 
though it is hoped to create these in the future. The current system therefore needs the 
source code to be downloaded and then run within a Rust development environment.</i>

<h3>Please use the Docs!</h3>

Details on configuring and initialising the system, using it and the various command line 
aarguments available, the internal database schemas used to store the ROR data and the outputs provided 
can all be found within the docs section on this GitHub page. Those documemts are written assuming only a 
very basic knowledge of Rust and its development environment. 

The summary below assumes greater familiarity with Rust, Cargo and Postgres, and is designed to provide a quick 
overview of the system. The more detailed documents should be consulted by anyone wishing to use the system or 
anyone seeking a more detailed understanding of what it does.

<h3>Summary of Installation and Routine use</h3>

<h4>Pre-requisites</h4>
<ul>
<li> Download the code on this GitHub page and access it within a Rust development environment. VS Code is recommended.</li>
<li> Install Postgres if not already available and establish an empty database (by default called 'ror', though any name can be used). The empty database must be
created prior to the initial run of the system, but all other database operations are handled by the system.</li>
<li> Download the ror files required, from Zenodo, and place the V2 json files in the folder to be used as the source data folder.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Initialising the system</h4>
The system uses a configuration file to provide details of the database connection, and the folders holding data, output files amd logs. 
This configuration file must be established during the intial running of the system.<br/>
<i>On initial run:</i>
<ul>
<li>In the development environment (e.g. in the terminal in VS Code) input 'cargo run'. Because the program will not be able to find a configuration file it will automatically switch to 'initialisation mode'. </li>
<li>In this mode the system will ask for various parameters: the postgress database host, user name, user password, port and database name, the folder where data source files will be found, 
and the folders to be used for outputs and logs. It will also ask for an optional source file name, though in most scenarios this can be left as an empty string (see Docs for details).</li>
<li>The values should be supplied in response to each of the prompts, after which a configuration file is constructed.</li>
<li>Initial use of the configuration file is in creating lookup and summary tables.</li>
<li>The system is then ready for routine use</li>
</ul>

<h4>Routine use</h4>
<ul>
<li>In most scenarios, data can be input, processed and output by the system using a single command.</li>
<li>This involves running the system with the -a (all) flag and the -s source file flag, as in <b><i>cargo run -- -a -s "&lt;source-file-name&gt;"</i></b>, e.g. <i>cargo run -- -a -s "v1.59-2025-01-23-ror-data_schema_v2.json"</i>.</li>
<li>The -a command will take the data in the json file through a four stage pipeline:</li> 
<ul>
    <li>importing it into a set of 'ror' schema tables, with very little change;</li>
    <li>transforming it, albeit lightly, into a series of 'src' schema tables, and </li>
    <li>summarising statistics of the data set and storing those in 'smm' schema tables.</li>
    <li>generating a text file presenting the summary data from the imported version, in a series of tables.</li>
    <li>more information on the ror, src and smm tables is provided inthe Docs.</li>
</ul>
<li>Successive use of the -a command will overwrite the data in the ror and src schema tables, with data from whatever is the most recently imported version. The summary smm schema data for each version is, however, stored permanently.</li>
<li><i>cargo run -- -x</i> will generate a set of 7 csv files with the summary data linked to the current (most recently imported) version. Specifying a different version is also possible as long as it has been previously imported and summarised.</li>
<li><i>cargo run -- -y</i> will generate a set of 7 csv files with the summary data from all the versions imported to that point.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Summary of Command line arguments</h4>

The folowing command line arguments are available:

<i><b>-s</b></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[or -source]. Followed by a string representing the source file name. This must be double quoted if it includes a space. (If it does not include the '.json' extension that will be added by the system before processing). 

<i><b>-v</b></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[or -data_version]. Followed by a double quoted string representing a version number, e.g. "v1.52". In many circumstances can be derived from the source file name (see below).

<i><b>-d</b></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[or -date]. Followed by a double quoted string in ISO YYYY-mm-DD format, representing the date of the data. In many circumstances can be derived from the source file name (see below).

<i><b>N.B. If the file name starts with a 'v' followed by a semantic versioning string, followed by a space or a hyphen and then the date in ISO format, either with hyphens or without, then (whatever any following text in the name) the system is able to extract the data version and date from the file name. It is then no longer necessary to provide the data version and date separately. File names such as v1.58-2024-12-11-ror-data_schema_v2.json, v1.51-20240821.json, v1.48 20240620.json, and v1.47 2024-05-30.json all follow the required pattern. The first is the form of the name supplied by ROR, so renaming the file is not necessary.</b></i>

<i><b>-a</b></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[or -all]. Run all three main processes for a particular ROR data version (equivalent to -r, -p, and -t together). The source file, data version and data date must be specified, but the latter two can usually be derived from the first.

<i><b>-r</b></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[or -import]. A flag that causes import of the specified source data to ror schema tables, but not to the src schema. The source file, data version and data date must be specified.  

<i><b>-p</b></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[or -process]. A flag that causes processing and summarising of the data in the ror schema tables to the src and smm schema tables. By default the system uses the version that is currently resident in the ror tables.

<i><b>-t</b></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[or -text]. A flag that causes production of a text file summarising the main features of a version currently held within the system's summary tables.

<i><b>-x</b></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[or -export]. A flag that causes production of a collection of 7 csv files, representing the data in the summary tables for the specified version. 

<i><b>-y</b></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[or -exportall]. A flag that causes production of a collection of 7 csv files, representing <i>all</i> the data in the summary tables, for all imported versions.

<b><i>Note that if any of the three 'set up' flags described below, -c, -k or -m, are used, all other flags and parameters will be ignored. The system will simply rebuild the configuration file and / or lookup and / or summary tables.</b></i>

<i><b>-c</b></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[or -config]. A flag that causes the configuration file to be edited (prompts for each data point are re-presented to the user).

<i><b>-k</b></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[or -lookup]. A flag that causes the lookup tables to be regenerated. Generally only used if the code or data for these tables has been revised. 

<i><b>-m</b></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[or -summsetup]. A flag that causes the re-establishment of the summary tables in the smm schema. NOTE - ANY EXISTING DATA IN THOSE TABLES WILL BE DESTROYED.
